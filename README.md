# Responsive Carousel

Responsive Carousel is a mobile-first carousel provider by Flickr API, with React.

## How it should work

  - The ‘active’ carousel item is always centred in its container
  - When you click the prev button, it should centre the previous item
  - When you click the next button, it should centre the next item
  - As you scale up the browser window more of the carousel becomes visible

## Best practices

  - Code structure, quality and consistency
  - Accessibility
  - Performance
  - Cross browser compatibility
  - Responsive
  - Dependency management
  - Test
  - BEM CSS
